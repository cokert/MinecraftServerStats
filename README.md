# MC Server Stats

This project is a [Shiny](http://shiny.com) app that will read the logs of hosted Minecraft servers.  It should work with any server hosted using Multicraft, but it's only been tested to work with servers hosted on [ExodusHosting's](http://exodushosting.net) servers.  The idea came because I was learning R and my "friend" Chad was REALLY BAD AT MINECRAFT (hence the header text in the Shiny pages).

It extracts and displays various stats based on the following items
 - Playtime
 - Deaths
 - Achievements
 - Chat Log
  
The chat log is available as a filterable Bootstrap DataTable.  The full contents of the logs are also available as a filterable Bootstrap DataTable.
